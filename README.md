We’re building a smart savings and budgeting feature that can be added to apps like PhonePe, GPay, or Paytm. Every time you spend money using UPI—like buying coffee or ordering food—the app will automatically round up your payment (for example, from ₹97.50 to ₹100) and put the small leftover amount into a virtual savings jar. You can create different jars for different goals like a Goa trip, a new phone, or an emergency fund. The system uses AI to understand your spending habits and will alert you if you're about to overspend in any category like food, shopping, or entertainment. It also gives you small nudges and challenges to help you save more, making the whole process fun and motivating. It’s like having a mini financial coach inside your digital wallet that helps you save money without even realizing it.
